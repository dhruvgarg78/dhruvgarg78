# Hey there! I’m Dhruv
I build **small but mighty CNNs**, **lightweight LLMs**, and **AI-powered automation tools**. Lately, I’ve been diving into **GRPO models** and **multimodal LLMs** 🧠💻.

## 🔹 Projects I’m Proud Of

### [mcp-drawing-agent](https://github.com/dhruvgarg78/mcp-drawing-agent) 🎨🤖
Control Paint with plain English commands—powered by **Google Gemini** and the **MCP agent framework**. Automates drawing tasks with natural language instructions.

### [CIFAR10](https://github.com/dhruvgarg78/CIFAR10) 🖼️⚡
Tiny CNN, **huge impact**: **90.5% accuracy** with under 190k parameters. Demonstrates high efficiency in compact models.

### [MNIST-CI-CD](https://github.com/dhruvgarg78/MNIST-CI-CD) 🧪🚀
Full **CI/CD pipeline** for MNIST CNNs: automated **training, testing, deployment**, and **parameter validation** (<100k).

### [reddit-rag-fact-bot](https://github.com/dhruvgarg78/reddit-rag-fact-bot) 📚🤓
RAG-based bot that **fact-checks historical claims** on Reddit, integrating embeddings, FAISS retrieval, and Gemini language generation.

### [SmolMoE-864×30](https://github.com/dhruvgarg78/SmolMoE-362M-Docker) 🤖🛠️
Compact **Mixture-of-Experts LLM**, Dockerized, checkpointed to showcase **architecture design, parameter accounting, and serving pipelines**.

### [bpe-tokenizer-hindi](https://github.com/dhruvgarg78/bpe-tokenizer-hindi) 📝🇮🇳
Efficient **Hindi BPE tokenizer**: 4500 tokens, **9.24× compression**, optimized for performance and Hugging Face integration.
